_Startup means that this was the first time run in a new Open-Sora docker. Long2XXXYYY_ZZZ runs were intended to investigate differences in energy use for different fram counts (XXX) and resolutions (YYY), but insufficient data was collected to make conclusions, in part due to the insufficient capacity of the Nvidia RTX 4090 - the maximum video length was ~120 frames, and the maximum resolution seems to be 240p regardless of frame count. This is also why there are two failed runs; I tried to run with higher resolutions (480p and 720p at various video lengths) but it would fail at some point after starting. In hindsight, I would hope to save more failed run data. What we did see from the different video lengths was an approximately linear relationship between video length and energy use (and at 36 frames a sharp drop), but there was not enough data collected to make a proper conclusion.
